mkxlboot
--------

The mkxlblob command is used to create combined images for use with the
XL-Boot boot loader. These images are refered as XL-Blob.  The  XL-Blob
consists of a simple bootstub code and payload data. These payload data
can contain a secon stage boot loader,  the  linux  kernel,  other  os,
firmware images, etc. The bootstub code is a simple PIC executable blob
that copies payload data to its linked address and executes it.

For more information please read man page: mkxlblob.1
